        # Components
        - Grafana
        - PostgreSQL
        - Docker
        - Python data gathering scripts on Debian
        - Custom grafana Panel Plugins to visualize flight data

        # Context and Benefits 

        This project was started after our python and LabView based systems were found
        to be insufficiently flexible for our needs with the in-flight engine control 
        hardware that was being developed. The in-flight engine controller required our 
        frontend visualization systems to be more adaptable as it evolved
        into its final configuration.

        The grafana based solution provided a visual editor which allowed quick edits to data
        sources and graphs as sensors were added and removed from the system. It allowed for faster
        component failure detection as well. This suited us quite well.

        The usage of PostgreSQL was mostly due to familiarity. It was later found as we approached 
        the launch date that PostgreSQL was not the best choice but the performance was found to be
        acceptable with some tuning. So through intertia we stuck with it. We plan to switch to a 
        more appropriate time series database i.e., InfluxDB on the next testing and flight system.

        The custom panel plugins that I created was a panel which could display the pitch and yaw of 
        the rocket as it was in flight. This was quite simmilar to dials used in reaaal flight systems
        to display this information.

        We used docker since one of the other problems encountered witht heold system was the inability 
        to run it reliably acorss different people computer's. The old codebase was worked on by many
        members on a shared test computer with changes made as required. This resulted in machine specific
        dependenices and quirks. Thie docker based system allowed us to rely on us being able to bring
        up a working data accquistion and visualization on any device that had docker insntalled which
        allowed for faster development.

        # The Big Day

        The most critical day for this system was obviously on the day of the launch of the rocket. 
        On this day, this sytem ws run for over 10 hours in the sweltering heat of the Mojave desert
        and was found to be reliable for all of it. The system was up and running immediately once 
        the hardware was on the network unlike our previous systems which would require fiddling around
         and full restarts of the our test computer if any wires were moved.

        There was a undiagnosed failure enar the end which stopped updating the UI. This was worked 
        around by running the system on different computer. We suspect a hardware fault in the computer 
        since the other computer was immediately stable without any issues. This showed the benefits of 
        the docker based approach as it allowed us tomigrate to a seprate machine when the primary system 
        failed on us.

        # Roadmap

        As mentioned we will be switching to InfluxDB since it is a far more appropriate system for our
        application. There is also a Telegraf which is a agent that complements InfluxDB which is under 
        consideration. The usage of InfluxDB will provide us with better time series capabilities in our
        database providing window based averaging and other processsing in the database so we can avoid 
        visualizing thousands of data points.

        The Telegraf system is for a live count of system conditions. It provides a push based feed to 
        the grafana frontend over websocket. It will also act as the agent the collects information from 
        the engine control systemsand feed them to the database.

        # Componenets
        - Teensy 4.1 MCU
        - W5500 10BASE-T Ethernet Module over SPI
        - MAX31855 temperature sensing IC's

        # Context and Benefits
        
        The UCI Rocket Project was at a point where we in a position to Veritically Test Fire in Late
        Janurary of 2023. Upto this point all Avionics systems would remain on the ground and didn't 
        need to implemented in such an integrated package. With our successfull vertical firing of the
        engine came the desire to put the avionics in flight-ready configuration. This was the task of 
        the Engine Control Unit 1.5.

        It integrated previously disparate actuation and sensor data measurement systems into one 
        complete package to be put on our Prelimiary Test Rocket. The major wins on this was the 
        highly reliable commuication system since it used mostly off the shelf networking equipment.
        This allowed to apply knowledge from our netowrking systems claasses to make the system 
        more efficient as well in terms of wiring costs as we reudced the length of total necessary 
        cables by 33%.

        # Problems

        The temperature sensor was huge challenge since we were in a very noisy electromagnetically 
        noisy environment with solenoids valves opening and closing caausing it to haave very noisy 
        readings as well. This will need to be addressed in a future design.

        # Roadmap

        A new engine control unit is under design for the UCI Rocket Project REAPER rocket. This
        will have a better feedback system for solenoids and will caarry forward many of the same 
        design choices while trying too make it more robust to mistakes in the connections to various
        sensors to protect from human errors.

        This utilizes a Svelte based frontend and a Go backend in order to create a graph from given 
        sensor data. Currently this is in development and hence only support postgresql as a data source.
        Additionally, I only have Linear Regression implemented for online analysis of the data. 

        The system works by pushing new data to the client using websockets. It implements ping/ping pattern
        in order to make sure that the client has a live connection to the server and that the server is still
        present. Furhter, it has reconnection and exponential backoff based retries built into the system in
        order to make sure network is not overloaded if the server is currently not accessible. This also makes
        sure that we get live data back as soon as a connection to the server is possible.

        Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

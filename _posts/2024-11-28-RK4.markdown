# RK4
Goal is to demonstrate how simulators can be written.


- ball falling with air resistance
- LRC circuit?
- emf calculation using the pde
- discretizaiton using finite element method
# Basic implementation in python using numpy

Obviouly real solvers should be used but this shows the simplicity of writing simple simulators.

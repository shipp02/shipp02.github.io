    ,"content"  : "After 6 years of hardwork from the UCI Rocket Project team and a year of my own involvement in the project, we launched PTR our Prelimiary Test Rocket. This was quite the milestone since it is UCI’s first liquid fuel bi-propellant rocket. We got to a maximum altitude of 9300ft. After our successful hotfire of the rocket engine in flight configuration in January 2023, we pulled the system together in just 3 months. The Avionics Systems on this rocket were the Engine Controller, the Avionics Flight System and a transmitter module for live telemetry. These were developed by us in-house. The parachutes deployment system was a commercial EasyMiniv3 system from Altus Metrum. My primary role was the developmet of the software for the control of the engine. This included the grafana data analysis system that I deployed. We also has a P&amp;ID control diagram to help visualize the status of the rocket. I also developed the software for the Engine Control Unit (ECU) which involved embedded programming on a teensy4.1 board. The ECU accepted commands over a IP based network which made it very convinient during development. I also helped make the builds of the software more robust through the use of platformio which helped people collborate with each other. With all the tech out of the way, I would like to thank our leads and management for their contributions to the project. I would specifically like to thank our cheif engineer for inspiring me to become a better engineer and a diplomatic team player. I have known some flaws in my attitude towards my work. I had put off improving on these but he gave me a reality check and put me on a path to improvement. This has helped me on a couple of personal projects and helped me push past points where I would normally have given up on them. With that technical stuff out of the way, let me express my gratitude to our leads and management for their efforts to the project. I would like to acknowledge our chief engineer in particular for driving me to grow as an engineer and a diplomatic team member. I am aware of several shortcomings in the way I approach my work. He gave me a reality check and set me on the path to progress because I had put off working on issues. This has benefited me in a few personal projects and allowed me to push through obstacles that might have otherwise caused me to quit. Thank you, to the entire team of UCIRP Liquids for your hardwork and support! #REAPER"

The in-flight engine controller required our frontend visualization systems to be more adaptable as it evolved into its final configuration. The grafana based solution provided a visual editor which allowed quick edits to data sources and graphs as sensors were added and removed from the system. It allowed for faster component failure detection as well. This suited us quite well. The usage of PostgreSQL was mostly due to familiarity. It was later found as we approached the launch date that PostgreSQL was not the best choice but the performance was found to be acceptable with some tuning. So through inertia we stuck with it. We plan to switch to a more appropriate time series database i.e. Influx DB on the next testing and flight system. The custom panel plugins that I created was a panel which could display the pitch and yaw of the rocket as it was in flight. This was quite similar to dials used in real flight systems to display this information. We used docker since one of the other problems encountered with the old system was the inability to run it reliably across different people computer's. The old code base was worked on by many members on a shared test computer with changes made as required. This resulted in machine specific dependencies and quirks. The docker based system allowed us to rely on us being able to bring up a working data acquisition and visualization on any device that had docker installed which allowed for faster development. # The Big Day The most critical day for this system was obviously on the day of the launch of the rocket. On this day this system was run for over 10 hours in the sweltering heat of the Mojave desert and was found to be reliable for all of it. The system was up and running immediately once the hardware was on the network unlike our previous systems which would require fiddling around and full restarts of the our test computer if any wires were moved. There was a undiagnosed failure near the end which stopped updating the GUI. This was worked around by running the system on different computer. We suspect a hardware fault in the computer since the other computer was immediately stable without any issues. This showed the benefits of the docker based approach as it allowed us to migrate to a different machine when the primary system failed on us. # Roadmap As mentioned we will be switching to Influx DB since it is a far more appropriate system for our application. There is also a Telegraf which is a agent that complements Influx DB which is under consideration. The usage of Influx DB will provide us with better time series capabilities in our database providing window based averaging and other processing in the database so we can avoid visualizing thousands of data points. The Telegram system is for a live count of system conditions. It provides a push based feed to the grafana frontend over websocket. It will also act as the agent the collects information from the engine control systems and feed them to the database. type id_example project_name PTR Engine Control System project_excerpt In-Flight Engine Control System for UCI Rocket Project's Preliminary Test Rocket img :ECU.jpg img_title ECU-1.5 Orion date 2023-05-18 post ## Components - Teensy 4.1 MCU - W5500 10BASE-T Ethernet Module over SPI - MAX31855 temperature sensing IC's ## Context and Benefits The UCI Rocket Project was at a point where we in a position to Veritically Test Fire in Late January of 2023. Up to this point all Avionics systems would remain on the ground and didn't need to implemented in such an integrated package. With our successful vertical firing of the engine came the need to put the avionics in flight-ready configuration. The ECU-1.5 was designed with this in mind. The system was designed to be compatible with the original ECU that was used for the Vertical Test Fire. It integrated previously disparate actuation and sensor data measurement systems into one complete package to be put on our Preliminary Test Rocket. The major wins on this was the highly reliable communication system since it used mostly off the shelf networking equipment. This allowed to apply knowledge from our networking systems classes to make the system more efficient as well in terms of wiring costs as we reduced the length of total necessary cables by 33%. Further the number of packets transferred for every action was dropped to 1/3 of it's original rate which increased the responsiveness of the system. This was even extended to take over some of the duties of our old and somewhat troublesome LabView system. We used one of the spare ECU-1.5 boards to replace it. On the first run this caused havoc on our network since 2 of these boards had never been tested to run in parallel on the same network. I found that this was because of a somewhat gnarly issue at the link layer where both boards were programmed to have the same MAC address. ## Problems The temperature sensor was huge challenge since we were in a very noisy electro-magnetically noisy environment with solenoids valves opening and closing causing it to have very noisy readings as well. This will need to be addressed in a future design. ## Roadmap A new engine control unit is under design for the UCI Rocket Project REAPER rocket. This will have a better feedback system for solenoids and will carry forward many of the same design choices while trying too make it more robust to mistakes in the connections to various sensors to protect from human errors. type id_example project_name Grafana Clone project_excerpt A graphing system inspired by grafana which is incremental by default and can provide online analysis of real-time data. img_title Photo of the whole application date 2023-05-19 post This utilizes a Svelte based frontend and a Go backend in order to create a graph from given sensor data. Currently this is in development and hence only support postgresql as a data source. Additionally I only have Linear Regression implemented for online analysis of the data. The system works by pushing new data to the client using websockets. It implements ping/ping pattern in order to make sure that the client has a live connection to the server and that the server is still present. Further it has reconnection and exponential back-off based retries built into the system in order to make sure network is not overloaded if the server is currently not accessible. This also makes sure that we get live data back as soon as a connection to the server is possible. type id_example project_name Micro-mouse project_excerpt Built a Micro-mouse robot which was to compete in AAMC img_title 2023-05-28 post I undertook this project in my Freshman Year at UCI. We received funding from the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). For this competition we manufactured and assembled a PCB and developed the software to navigate the Micro-mouse through the maze. The main issue we faced in this case was that we had under powered the H-Bridge which caused one of our motors to not receive power at the same time as the other. This meant that we had to compensate for this quite heavily in software. A large portion of the learning from this competition was also using nested PID control loops. Our initial software only used PID's to make the robot go straight but we slowly realized that we would need PID control loops to ensure we move a consistent distance every time and to turn properly. We were caught off guard by the effects of physics in our system which we had not considered until we were quite late in the design process. We failed to account for momentum of our system and how battery voltage would affect how much momentum had when we tried to stop. This made the learning curve quite steep overall."

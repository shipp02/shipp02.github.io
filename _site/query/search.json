The in-flight engine controller required our frontend visualization systems to be more adaptable as it evolved into its final configuration. The grafana based solution provided a visual editor which allowed quick edits to data sources and graphs as sensors were added and removed from the system. It allowed for faster component failure detection as well. This suited us quite well. The usage of PostgreSQL was mostly due to familiarity. It was later found as we approached the launch date that PostgreSQL was not the best choice but the performance was found to be acceptable with some tuning. So through intertia we stuck with it. We plan to switch to a more appropriate time series database i.e. InfluxDB on the next testing and flight system. The custom panel plugins that I created was a panel which could display the pitch and yaw of the rocket as it was in flight. This was quite simmilar to dials used in reaaal flight systems to display this information. We used docker since one of the other problems encountered witht heold system was the inability to run it reliably acorss different people computer's. The old codebase was worked on by many members on a shared test computer with changes made as required. This resulted in machine specific dependenices and quirks. Thie docker based system allowed us to rely on us being able to bring up a working data accquistion and visualization on any device that had docker insntalled which allowed for faster development. # The Big Day The most critical day for this system was obviously on the day of the launch of the rocket. On this day this sytem ws run for over 10 hours in the sweltering heat of the Mojave desert and was found to be reliable for all of it. The system was up and running immediately once the hardware was on the network unlike our previous systems which would require fiddling around and full restarts of the our test computer if any wires were moved. There was a undiagnosed failure enar the end which stopped updating the UI. This was worked around by running the system on different computer. We suspect a hardware fault in the computer since the other computer was immediately stable without any issues. This showed the benefits of the docker based approach as it allowed us tomigrate to a seprate machine when the primary system failed on us. # Roadmap As mentioned we will be switching to InfluxDB since it is a far more appropriate system for our application. There is also a Telegraf which is a agent that complements InfluxDB which is under consideration. The usage of InfluxDB will provide us with better time series capabilities in our database providing window based averaging and other processsing in the database so we can avoid visualizing thousands of data points. The Telegraf system is for a live count of system conditions. It provides a push based feed to the grafana frontend over websocket. It will also act as the agent the collects information from the engine control systemsand feed them to the database. type id_example project_name PTR Engine Control System project_excerpt In-Flight Engine Control System for UCI Rocket Project's Preliminary Test Rocket img :ECU.jpg img_title ECU-1.5 Orion date 2023-05-18 post # Componenets - Teensy 4.1 MCU - W5500 10BASE-T Ethernet Module over SPI - MAX31855 temperature sensing IC's # Context and Benefits The UCI Rocket Project was at a point where we in a position to Veritically Test Fire in Late Janurary of 2023. Upto this point all Avionics systems would remain on the ground and didn't need to implemented in such an integrated package. With our successfull vertical firing of the engine came the desire to put the avionics in flight-ready configuration. This was the task of the Engine Control Unit 1.5. It integrated previously disparate actuation and sensor data measurement systems into one complete package to be put on our Prelimiary Test Rocket. The major wins on this was the highly reliable commuication system since it used mostly off the shelf networking equipment. This allowed to apply knowledge from our netowrking systems claasses to make the system more efficient as well in terms of wiring costs as we reudced the length of total necessary cables by 33%. # Problems The temperature sensor was huge challenge since we were in a very noisy electromagnetically noisy environment with solenoids valves opening and closing caausing it to haave very noisy readings as well. This will need to be addressed in a future design. # Roadmap A new engine control unit is under design for the UCI Rocket Project REAPER rocket. This will have a better feedback system for solenoids and will caarry forward many of the same design choices while trying too make it more robust to mistakes in the connections to various sensors to protect from human errors. type id_example project_name Grafana Clone project_excerpt A graphing system inspired by grafana which is incremental by default and can provide online analysis of real-time data. img_title Photo of the whole application date 2023-05-19 post This utilizes a Svelte based frontend and a Go backend in order to create a graph from given sensor data. Currently this is in development and hence only support postgresql as a data source. Additionally I only have Linear Regression implemented for online analysis of the data. The system works by pushing new data to the client using websockets. It implements ping/ping pattern in order to make sure that the client has a live connection to the server and that the server is still present. Furhter it has reconnection and exponential backoff based retries built into the system in order to make sure network is not overloaded if the server is currently not accessible. This also makes sure that we get live data back as soon as a connection to the server is possible. type id_picture project_name Example Project project_excerpt Picture img :project2_thumb.jpg img_title img title2 date 2021-04-23 post # Title This is project content. !Image(:project2_thumb.jpg) type id_quote project_name Example Project project_excerpt William Shakespeare date 2021-05-27 post Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments.

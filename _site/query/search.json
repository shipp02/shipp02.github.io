The in-flight engine controller required our frontend visualization systems to be more adaptable as it evolved into its final configuration. The grafana based solution provided a visual editor which allowed quick edits to data sources and graphs as sensors were added and removed from the system. It allowed for faster component failure detection as well. This suited us quite well. The usage of PostgreSQL was mostly due to familiarity. It was later found as we approached the launch date that PostgreSQL was not the best choice but the performance was found to be acceptable with some tuning. So through intertia we stuck with it. We plan to switch to a more appropriate time series database i.e. InfluxDB on the next testing and flight system. We used docker since one of the other problems encountered witht heold system was the inability to run it reliably acorss different people computer's. The old codebase was worked on by many members on a shared test computer with changes made as required. This resulted in machine specific dependenices and quirks. Thie docker based system allowed us to rely on us being able to bring up a working data accquistion and visualization on any device that had docker insntalled which allowed for faster development. # The Big Day The most critical day for this system was obviously on the day of the launch of the rocket. On this day this sytem ws run for over 10 hours in the sweltering heat of the Mojave desert and was found to be reliable for all of it. The system was up and running immediately once the hardware was on the network unlike our previous systems which would require fiddling around and full restarts of the our test computer if any wires were moved. There was a undiagnosed failure enar the end which stopped updating the UI. This was worked aroundn by running the system on different computer. We suspect a hardware fault in the computer since the other computer was immediately stable without any issues. This showed the benefits of the docker based approach as it allowed us to migrate to a seprate machine when the primary system failed on us. # Roadmap As mentioned we will be switching to InfluxDB since it is a far more appropriate system for our application. There is also a Telegraf which is a agent that complements InfluxDB which is under consideration. The usage of InfluxDB will provide us with better time series capabilities in our database providing window based averaging and other processsing in the database so we can avoid visualizing thousands of data points. The Telegraf system is for a live count of system conditions. It provides a push based feed to the grafana frontend over websocket. It will also act as the agent the collects information from the engine control systems and feed them to the database. type id_example project_name PTR Engine Control System project_excerpt In-Flight Engine Control System for UCI Rocket Project's Preliminary Test Rocket img :ECU.jpg img_title ECU-1.5 Orion date 2023-05-18 post type id_picture project_name Example Project project_excerpt Picture img :project2_thumb.jpg img_title img title2 date 2021-04-23 post # Title This is project content. !Image(:project2_thumb.jpg) type id_quote project_name Example Project project_excerpt William Shakespeare date 2021-05-27 post Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove. O no it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wand'ring barque Whose worth's unknown although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks But bears it out even to the edge of doom.

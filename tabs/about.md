I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) studying Computer Science and Engineering. I will complete my degree in **March 2025**.

I am passionate about embedded and autonomous systems and I have been part of the **UCI Rocket Project** and IEEE@UCI's **Micromouse** project. As part of these, I have worked with **MCUs** including the Teensy 4.0 and STM32. Further, we used a range of **sensors** including thermocouples, IR sensors, wheel encoders, pressure transducers, and more.

I have taken **courses** in Digital Signal Processing **DSP** covering LTI systems, Bode plots, and FFTs. To **advance myself** in the field of controls, I have studied and implemented *EKFs*, and *PID* controls. This has also given me a robust understanding of multivariate Gaussian distributions.

I am **looking for opportunities** in the Automotive and Robotics fields. I aim to embody a strong engineering culture that focuses on solving problems, not finding fault. Further, I am personable and can admit my mistakes while standing up for what I think is the right idea.

I have basic **manufacturing skills** in 3D printing and machining using lathes and mills.
